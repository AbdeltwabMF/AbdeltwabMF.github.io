My name is <strong>Abd El-Twab M. Fakhry</strong> (aka amf). I am an experienced C/C++, Java, and Python programmer with a working knowledge of Linux and advanced knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I am a Free Software Enthusiast. Just another programmer with too many opinions. I am not the best, but Iâ€™m pretty good.

I am also a competitive programmer and a dApp developer.
